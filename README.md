# About NomPy
NomPy is an application designed to search for free food events by parsing data from RSS feeds. The program plots the results as a map and table while exporting calendar events and a CSV summary to the current directory. Users can choose to run the program from a Python interpreter or from the exexcutable file. 

## User Inputs
### Input GUI
After running NomPy, the user will first encounter a graphical interface to set the preferences for the event search. The user has the option of adding additional search terms as well as new RSS feeds. 
#### Adding a new RSS Feed:
The user can add a new RSS feed to the search by providing the link to the feed (click "Subscribe to Feed"), not the hosting page itself.
